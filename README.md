Code for a Project for the lecture "**Hyperspaces**" of my masters degree "**Design & Computation**" at **UDK** and **TU Berlin**.

The project enables the experience and triggering of memories through auditory stimuli by defining a memory through a questionnaire and extracting key sound events and prompts for those through an LLM. These prompts are then used to generate sounds via **AudioLDM2**, played back on multiple channels of a defined audio interface.

# TODO:
- [ ] Add a env file for api key and defining interface, number of sound events and channels
